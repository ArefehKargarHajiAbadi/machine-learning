    "# Bayesian Network \n",
    "A Bayesian Network (BN) is a type of Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) that uses a graph structure to represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies. It provides a framework for reasoning under uncertainty by efficiently calculating complex joint probability distributions.\n",
    "## Structure and Components\n",
    "A Bayesian Network consists of two main parts: the structure and the parameters.              \n",
    "### 1. Structure (Qualitative Component)\n",
    "The structure is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):\n",
    "- Nodes (Vertices): Each node represents a random variable (e.g., Symptom, Disease, Event). These variables can be discrete (like 'True' or 'False') or continuous.\n",
    "- Edges (Links): Directed edges (arrows) between nodes represent a direct conditional dependency or a causal influence.If an arrow goes from Node A to Node B ($A \\to B$), A is the parent of B, and B is the child of A. This means $B$ is conditionally dependent on $A$.\n",
    "- Acyclic: The graph must contain no directed cycles (you can't start at a node and follow the arrows back to the same node).\n",
    "### 2. Parameters (Quantitative Component)\n",
    "The parameters quantify the probabilistic relationships:\n",
    "- Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs): Each node $X_i$ in the network is associated with a CPD, which is the probability of $X_i$ given its parents, $P(X_i | \\text{Parents}(X_i))$.\n",
    "- Prior Probability: For nodes that have no parents (root nodes), the CPD is simply the unconditional probability of the variable, $P(X_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature of the BN structure is that it encodes conditional independence. If a node has no edge from another node, it is conditionally independent of that node, given its parents. This allows the network to factorize the Joint Probability Distribution of all variables, making complex probability calculations manageable:$$P(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | \\text{Parents}(X_i))$$\n",
    "## Core Task: \n",
    "Probabilistic InferenceThe primary use of a Bayesian Network is inference. This involves calculating the probability distribution of a set of unknown variables given the observed values (evidence) of other variables.\n",
    "- Example (Medical Diagnosis):\n",
    "      -Evidence: The patient has a Cough (Observed $\\rightarrow$ known).Query: What is the probability the patient has Flu? (Unknown $\\rightarrow$ inferred).The network can compute $P(\\text{Flu} | \\text{Cough})$ using the structure and the CPDs, automatically applying Bayes' Theorem across the network."
